# Project settings in Migration Manager

Project settings in Migration Manager are easily accessed from the menu bar at the top of your screen.

The settings are designed to support each cloud provider. Depending on what cloud provider you're migrating from, you may see different options.

|Setting tab|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|File & folder filters|You can limit what is migrated by customizing the settings on this page. Specify if invalid characters  (" * : < > ? / \ \|) are allowed in a file or folder name, or choose to exclude specific file types or folder names, or by when they date create, and date modified. </br>Learn more: [**Invalid characters in OneDrive and SharePoint**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/office/restrictions-and-limitations-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa#invalidcharacters)|
|Permissions|These settings ensure that the same users with access to files, folders, and metadata will continue to have access after migration. </br>Learn more: [**Permission settings**](mm-project-settings-permissions.md)|
|Project details|Edit your project, find your Project ID, or disconnect from your source.|
|Advanced|If you're migrating Google Sheets, this setting allows a scan to identify incompatible formulas and embedded links, which may affect the converted Excel files. Learn more: [**Scan Google Sheet spreadsheets**](mm-google-sheet-scan.md).<br> *Advanced features are being developed to include other cloud migrations.*|

>[!Note]
>It's important to note that these settings are applied to all migrations unless you have customized individually. Changes won't be applied to migrations in progress.

# Step 3: Copy to migrations

After your Egnyte folders have been scanned and marked as ready, add them to your migration list.  

1. In the **Folders** tab, select the tasks (folders) with a scan status of "Ready to migrate".

1. Select **Copy to Folder migrations** from the action bar to activate the "Copy to migrations" setting panel.

1. Edit **Destinations**. You can apply [Single destination edit](/sharepointmigration/mm-egnyte-step4-review-destinations) or [Upload destinations using a CSV file](/sharepointmigration/mm-egnyte-step4-review-destinations) to designate where you want to migrate these selected tasks.

1. Review **Task migration settings**. You can either follow the [Project settings](/sharepointmigration/mm-project-settings) or customize the task settings.

1. Select **Copy to Folder migrations** to send the tasks to **Folder migrations** tab for subsequent migration operations.

1. Go to the **Folder Migrations** tab and proceed to the next step.

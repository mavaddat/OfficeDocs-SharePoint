# Overview: Migrate Egnyte using Migration Manager

Collaborate all in one place by migrating your Egnyte documents, data, and users to OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams in Microsoft 365. 


## How does it work?

- **Step 1:** [Connect to Egnyte](mm-egnyte-step1-connect.md) Sign in to your Egnyte account and add the Microsoft 365 migration app to your Egnyte app. 
- **Step 2:** [Scan and assess](mm-egnyte-step2-scan-assess.md) Egnyte accounts are scanned automatically for you. Once the scans are complete, download the generated reports and logs to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration.
- **Step 3:** [Copy to Migrations list](mm-egnyte-step3-copy-to-migrations.md) After an Egnyte account has been scanned and determined ready, add them to your migration list.
- **Step 4:** [Review destination paths](mm-egnyte-step4-review-destinations.md)  We automatically map source paths to any exactly matching destination paths. Ensure content is being copied to the right place by reviewing and modifying as needed for each destination path.
- **Step 5:** [Map identities](mm-egnyte-step5-map-identities.md)  Map your groups and users in Egnyte to an account in Microsoft 365 to migrate your Egnyte sharing settings.
- **Step 6:** [Migrate and Monitor](mm-egnyte-step6-migrate-monitor.md) After reviewing your migration setup, migrate your Egnyte accounts and monitor the progress


## Get started

To get started:

Navigate to [Microsoft 365 Admin Center Home - Setup - Migration and imports](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/featureexplorer/collections/Migrations), select **Egnyte** to create a migration project. Make sure that you have:

- **Access to the destination**: You must be one of the following roles in the Microsoft 365 tenant where you want to migrate your content: 

  - Global admin
  - OneDrive/SharePoint admin
  - User that is granted with the "[Microsoft 365 Migration Administrator](/sharepointmigration/mm-migration-admin-role)" role

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using lower permissioned accounts helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

- **Access to the source**: Have Egnyte account credentials that have read access to any Egnyte user account you plan to migrate.

- **Prerequisites installed:** Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

- **Request a rate increase from Egynte**.  Your new Egnyte application lets you connect to your Egnyte account. However, it's likely that it won't allow you to migrate content to Microsoft 365 due to the limits Egnyte imposes on new applications. Sign into your Egynte developer account to determine your existing rate limit. Then contact Egynte support to submit your request. 

**Sample request email:**

   **Subject:**  Egnyte connection</br>
   **Text:**     I would like the user rate limits increased for my application [*enter application name*] to [*x calls*] per second and [*y calls*] per day.

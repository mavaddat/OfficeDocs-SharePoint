# Migrate Box to Microsoft 365 with Migration Manager

Collaborate all in one place by migrating your Box documents, data, and users to OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams in Microsoft 365. 


## How does it work?

- **Step 1:** [Connect to Box](mm-box-step1-connect.md).   Sign in to your Box account and add the Microsoft 365 migration app to your Box account custom apps. 
- **Step 2:** [Scan and assess](mm-box-step2-scan-assess.md) Box user accounts are scanned automatically for you. Once the scans are complete, download the generated reports and logs to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration.
- **Step 3:** [Copy to Migrations list](mm-box-step3-copy-to-migrations.md) After a Box user has been scanned and determined ready, add them to your migration list.
- **Step 4:** [Review destination paths](mm-box-step4-review-destinations.md)  We automatically map source paths to any exactly matching destination paths. Ensure content is being copied to the right place by reviewing and modifying as needed for each destination path.
- **Step 5:** [Map identities](mm-box-step5-map-identities.md)   Map your groups and users in Box to an account in Microsoft 365 to migrate your Box sharing settings.
- **Step 6:** [Migrate and Monitor](mm-box-step6-migrate-monitor.md) After reviewing your migration setup, migrate your Box accounts and monitor the progress


## Get started

To get started:

Navigate to [Microsoft 365 Admin Center Home - Setup - Migration and imports](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/featureexplorer/collections/Migrations), select **Box** to create a migration project. Make sure that you have:

- **Access to the destination**: You must be one of the following roles in the Microsoft 365 tenant where you want to migrate your content: 

  - Global admin
  - OneDrive/SharePoint admin
  - User that is granted with the "[Microsoft 365 Migration Administrator](/sharepointmigration/mm-migration-admin-role)" role

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using lower permissioned accounts helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

- **Access to the source**: Have Box account credentials that have read access to any Box user account you plan to migrate.

- **Prerequisites installed:** Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.


## Box notes

Migration Manager now supports converting Box notes to .docx format. However, certain elements such as File Preview, Table of Contents, and Annotations will be omitted during the conversion process.

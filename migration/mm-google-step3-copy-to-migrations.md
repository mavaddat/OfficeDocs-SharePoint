# Step 3: Copy to Drive migrations tab for Google migration

After your Google Drives have been scanned, the drive status will show if it's error free and "Ready to migrate".  

1. In the **Drives** tab, select the tasks (Drives) with a scan status of "Ready to migrate".

1. Select **Copy to Drive migrations** from the action bar to activate the "Copy to migrations" setting panel.

1. Edit **Destinations**. You can apply [Single destination edit](/sharepointmigration/mm-google-step4-review-destinations) or [Upload destinations using a CSV file](/sharepointmigration/mm-google-step4-review-destinations) to designate where you want to migrate these selected tasks.

1. Review **Task migration settings**. You can either follow the [Project settings](/sharepointmigration/mm-project-settings) or customize the task settings.

1. Select **Copy to Drive migrations** to send the tasks to **Drive migrations** tab for subsequent migration operations.

1. Go to the **Drive Migrations** tab and proceed to the next step.

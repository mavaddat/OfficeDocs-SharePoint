# Migration Assessment Scan: InfoPath

Learn how to mitigate issues with InfoPath during migration.
  
## Overview

InfoPath enables developers to build custom forms for accepting user input in various locations throughout SharePoint. As part of the migration to the target environment, there are certain aspects of InfoPath forms that aren't supported in the target environment.
  
## Data Migration

InfoPath forms (XSN files) will be migrated, but some forms may not function without remediation.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

XSN files that use the following scenarios need to be remediated. If remediation doesn't occur, these forms fail post migration. The common scenarios are as follows:
  
- XSN or UDCX makes SOAP calls that aren't supported in the target environment. These forms need to be updated to call supported endpoints.

- XSN uses managed code that requires remediation. Managed code isn't supported on the target platform.

- InfoPath forms that use people picker fields. These fields need to be updated with the new user's identity post migration. This is because the on-premises identity (for example, Windows claims) doesn't match the user's Microsoft Entra ID / Microsoft 365 identity.

## Post Migration

Ensure the updated InfoPath forms function correctly during the migration user acceptance testing phase.
  
## Scan Result Reports

The following table describes the columns in the **InfoPath-detail.csv** report.
  
This scan report contains InfoPath forms that require remediation prior to migration, or at a minimum, validation on the new platform.
  
|**Column**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|SiteId  <br/> |Unique identifier of the impacted site collection.  <br/> |
|SiteURL  <br/> |URL to the impacted site collection.  <br/> |
|SiteOwner  <br/> |Owner of the site collection.  <br/> |
|SiteAdmins  <br/> |List of people listed as site collection administrators.  <br/> |
|SiteSizeInMB  <br/> |Size of the size collection in megabytes [MB]  <br/> |
|NumOfWebs  <br/> |Number of webs that exist in the site collection.  <br/> |
|ContentDBName  <br/> |Name of the content database hosting the site collection.  <br/> |
|ContentDBServerName  <br/> |SQL Server hosting the content database.  <br/> |
|ContentDBSizeInMB  <br/> |Size of the content database hosting the site collection.  <br/> |
|LastContentModifiedDate  <br/> |Date/Time the site collection had content modified.  <br/> |
|TotalItemCount  <br/> |Total number of items found in the site collection.  <br/> |
|Hits  <br/> |Number of requests logged for the site collection. Relies on data from the usage logging service. If the usage logging service is disabled this row shows N/A.  <br/> |
|DistinctUsers  <br/> |Number of distinct users that have accessed the site collection. Relies on data from the usage logging service. If the usage logging service is disabled this row shows N/A.  <br/> |
|DaysOfUsageData  <br/> |Number of days the usage logging service retains data. This provides context for Hits and DistinctUsers. For example, if this is 14 days, the Hits and DistinctUsers data is for the last 14 days.  <br/> |
|URL  <br/> |Locations of the XSN.  <br/> |
|URN  <br/> |Unique identifier for the XSN file. Each XSN file has a distinct URN.  <br/> |
|UnsupportedSoapCalls  <br/> |SOAP calls that aren't explicitly listed as supported by the target environment.  <br/> |
|UnsupportedSoapCallsCount  <br/> |Number of unsupported SOAP calls found in the XSN file.  <br/> |
|UnsupportedDataConnectionTypes  <br/> |Data connections that aren't supported on the new platform.  <br/> |
|UnsupportedDataConnectionCount  <br/> |Number of unsupported data connections.  <br/> |
|ManagedCode  <br/> |True - The XSN file has managed code associated with it. False - The XSN file doesn't have managed code associated with it.  <br/> |
|ManagedCodeState  <br/> |ValidationRequired - Managed code may work in the target environment. It requires validation during the migration testing phase to be sure.  <br/> RemediationRequired - The form has managed code that requires remediation.  <br/> |
|Mode  <br/> |The mode that the form was published in. </br>A mode of "Client" results in an InfoPath form that will only open in the InfoPath client. Whereas a mode of "Client Server" will open in both the browser and the InfoPath client. Forms with mode set to Client won't show up in this report.  <br/> Three more custom values are:</br>"WorkflowInitAssoc" - This value specifies that the form template (.xsn) file represents the form used to edit items in a workflow.</br>"List" - This value specifies that the form template (.xsn) file represents the form used to edit items in a list.</br>  "Entity" -This value specifies that the form template (.xsn) file represents the form used to edit items in an **external** list.|
|PeoplePickerCount  <br/> |Number of people picker fields found in the form.  <br/> |
|SolutionFormatVersion  <br/> |This field is no longer used and can be ignored.  <br/> |
|ProductVersion  <br/> |Version of InfoPath used to publish the form.  <br/> |
|ScanID  <br/> |Unique identifier assigned to a specific execution of the SharePoint Migration Assessment Tool.  <br/> |

# Migrate Dropbox to Microsoft 365 with Migration Manager


Collaborate all in one place by migrating your Dropbox documents, data, and users to OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams in Microsoft 365. 


## How does it work?

- **Step 1:** [Connect to Dropbox](mm-Dropbox-step1-connect.md).  Sign in to your Dropbox administrator account to connect to your Microsoft 365 migration.
- **Step 2:** [Scan and assess](mm-Dropbox-step2-scan-assess.md) Dropbox accounts are scanned automatically for you. Once the scans are complete, download the generated reports and logs to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration.
- **Step 3:** [Copy to Migrations list](mm-Dropbox-step3-copy-to-migrations.md) After Dropbox has been scanned and determined ready, add them to your migration list.
- **Step 4:** [Review destination paths](mm-Dropbox-step4-review-destinations.md)  We automatically map source paths to any exactly matching destination paths. Ensure content is being copied to the right place by reviewing and modifying as needed for each destination path.
- **Step 5:** [Map identities](mm-Dropbox-step5-map-identities.md)   Map your groups and users in Dropbox to an account in Microsoft 365 to migrate your Dropbox sharing settings.
- **Step 6:** [Migrate and Monitor](mm-Dropbox-step6-migrate-monitor.md) After reviewing your migration setup, migrate your Dropbox accounts and monitor the progress


## Get started

To get started:

Navigate to [Microsoft 365 Admin Center Home - Setup - Migration and imports](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/featureexplorer/collections/Migrations), select **Dropbox** to create a migration project. Make sure that you have:

- **Access to the destination**: You must be one of the following roles in the Microsoft 365 tenant where you want to migrate your content: 

  - Global admin
  - OneDrive/SharePoint admin
  - User that is granted with the "[Microsoft 365 Migration Administrator](/sharepointmigration/mm-migration-admin-role)" role

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using lower permissioned accounts helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

- **Access to the source**: Have Dropbox account credentials that have read access to any Dropbox user account you plan to migrate.

- **Prerequisites installed:** Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

# Migration Admin role

A Microsoft 365 Migration Administrator role is now available to provide access to Migration Manager within the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. Currently, your migration team must be assigned the SharePoint admin role, giving more access than needed. With this new role, you limit usage to only what is required to migrate your content, reserving SharePoint Admin access to only users who need it.

In addition, this role provides all the functionality required to migrate including the ability to:

- Access Migration Manager to migrate from file shares, Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, and Egnyte.
- Select migration sources, create migration inventories (such as Google Drive user lists), schedule and execute migrations, and download reports.
- Create new SharePoint sites if the destination sites don't already exist.
- Create SharePoint lists under the SharePoint admin sites.
- Create and update items in SharePoint lists.
- Manage migration project settings and migration lifecycle for tasks.
- Manage permission mappings from source to destination.

###  How to use

To use this feature, assign the migration admin role to a new or existing user. This role only allows access to Migration Manager.

>[!Note]
>Tabs may appear on the left navigation pane, including one for Groups, Users, Roles, and Settings. Users assigned the Migration Admin role can select and navigate these tabs, however, they are read-only.

>[!Important]
>You can continue to use Migration Manager as you currently do today.  Your projects will continue to work normally.

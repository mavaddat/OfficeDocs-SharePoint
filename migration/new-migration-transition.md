# New Migration Transition 

## About New Migration 
**New Migration** offers the same migration services currently provided through Migration Manager, but with a more scalable backend infrastructure. For most customers, the user experience (UX) remains unchanged, though some may notice transition-related UI elements. 

In contrast, **Old Migration** refers to the existing migration services without the upgraded infrastructure.  

## Transition Plan 
### Migration Manager Cloud Scenarios 
Customers migrating from Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, or Egnyte to Microsoft 365 will undergo the following transition process. 

#### New Customers 
Starting July 15, any new migration project created in Migration Manager by tenants who haven't previously initiated migration projects will automatically use New Migration. This change is seamless and doesn't impact the user experience in any way. 

#### Existing Customers 
Tenants with ongoing migration projects will experience transition UI elements: 
* **September 16th, 2024**: A UX prompt appears, providing an early notice about the upcoming transition. 
* **October 8th, 2024**: The Transition UI is released, featuring a New Migration switching panel in the top-right corner of the project page. You can select "Switch now" button to switch to the New Migration.
  + **Before Switching**: You may occasionally see pop-up prompts encouraging you to switch to New Migration. If you don't switch proactively, the transition is mandatory starting **November 11th**. 
  + **During Switching**: The transition process may take a few moments but doesn't affect your ongoing migration tasks. 
  + **After Switching**: New Migration becomes the default service, and new migration tasks can only be initiated in New Migration. An entry point to Old Migration remains available for reviewing or completing any unfinished migration tasks. Old Migration will be permanently closed on **December 11th**. Download any summary or detailed reports beforehand if you wish to retain the migration history from Old Migration.

### Migration Manager File Share Scenarios

Customers migrating from file share to Microsoft 365 will undergo the following transition process. The transition applies to scan tasks only, migration tasks aren't affected.

#### New Customers

Starting November 18, tenants who haven't previously initiated migration projects will automatically use New Migration for scan tasks. This change is seamless and doesn't impact the user experience in any way.

#### Existing Customers

# Updated Product Servicing Policy for SharePoint 2013

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-md.md)] 
  
During mainstream support, Microsoft releases new Public Update (PU) builds for SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013 each month which contain the latest functionality, performance, and stability improvements for the product.
  
## Policy overview

To ensure that customers have a high-quality experience, Microsoft is adopting the following product servicing policy for SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013:

- SharePoint Server 2013 Service Pack 1 and SharePoint Foundation 2013 Service Pack 1 will remain the minimum supported build through to the end of mainstream support on April 10, 2018.
- Starting with extended support on April 11, 2018 Microsoft will update the minimum supported build of SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013.
- To remain supported, you must be running SharePoint Server 2013's minimum supported build or its higher version.
- If you contact the Microsoft support team and your farm isn't running the minimum supported build or its higher version, you might be required to upgrade to that build before the Microsoft Support team can offer any further assistance.
  
The product servicing policy timeline for SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013 is described in the following table:

## Frequently Asked Questions

 **Question**: **Why is Microsoft doing this?** 
  
 **Answer**: Previously, servicing for SharePoint was tied to specific types of releases - the initial RTM release and service packs. However, Microsoft has no plans to release new service packs for SharePoint and will instead only update SharePoint by way of monthly Public Updates. This new servicing policy ensures that customers are running a build that contains fixes for the most common issues that customers have been reporting to us, even if more service packs aren't released.
  
 **Question**: **Where can I find the Public Updates for SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013?** 
  
 **Answer**: The current list of Public Updates for SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Foundation 2013 can be found in our [SharePoint Updates](/officeupdates/sharepoint-updates) article.

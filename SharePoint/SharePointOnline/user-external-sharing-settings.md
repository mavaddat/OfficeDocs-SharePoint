# Change the external sharing setting for a user's OneDrive

After you set the organization-wide sharing settings for Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft OneDrive, you can further restrict the external sharing for a specific OneDrive user. 

> [!TIP]
> Instead of changing the external sharing setting for an individual user's OneDrive, you might want to block external sharing of sensitive information with [Microsoft Purview data loss prevention](/purview/dlp-learn-about-dlp).
  
1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com.
    
2. In the left pane, select **Users** \> **Active users**.

3. Select the user.

4. Select the **OneDrive** tab, and under **Sharing**, select **Manage external sharing**.

5. Select a new external sharing level, and then select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also change the external sharing setting for a specific OneDrive user by using PowerShell and running the Set-SPOSite cmdlet with the parameter -SharingCapability. For more info, see [Set-SPOSite](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-sposite).

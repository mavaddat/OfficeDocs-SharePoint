# Generate App insights reports

[!INCLUDE[Advanced Management](includes/advanced-management.md)]

App insights is a [SharePoint Advanced Management](advanced-management.md) feature that lets [IT administrators](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles) gain insights on the various non-Microsoft applications registered to your Microsoft Entra admin center and how they access your SharePoint content. This report can help you maintain and protect the integrity of your content.

> [!NOTE]
>The App insights feature is currently in preview.

The report is based on the Microsoft audit data logged when a non-Microsoft application accesses content through the following set of events:

- FileAccessed
- FileDownloaded
- FileModified
- FileUploaded  

## Prerequisites

This feature requires Microsoft SharePoint Premium - SharePoint Advanced Management license.

For more information about SharePoint Online Management Shell, see [Getting started with SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).
3. Ensure you have the SharePoint Premium - SharePoint Advanced Management license.

## Known experiences

- In new tenants, it can take a few days for data to be available and for these reports to be generated successfully. In large tenants, the data can be delayed by up to 48 hours (about two days).  
- A report can be rerun only after 24 hours since the last report generation.
- There can only be one report for each value of **Report range**. This means that you can see a maximum of four reports in the **Enterprise Application Insights** homepage.
- These reports are powered by Audit data and don't include all audit events.  
- You might see App ID of a non-Microsoft app, but App name of a middle-tier app in some cases.

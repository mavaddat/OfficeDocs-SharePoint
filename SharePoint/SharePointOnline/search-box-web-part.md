# Change settings for the Search Box Web Part

The Search Box Web Part shows a text box where users can enter words or phrases to search for information. By default, the Search Box Web Part is used on the home page for the Search Center (default.aspx), and all default search results pages (**Everything**, **People**, **Conversations**, and **Videos**).
  
As a [SharePoint Administrator](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) or [above](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles) in Microsoft 365, you can change settings in the Search Box Web Part. You can:
  
- Change where the search results should be displayed â€” for example, show results in a custom Search Results Web Part or a custom search results page.
    
- Turn off query suggestions. 
    
- Show links to a search preference page and an advanced search page.
    
- Change the display template that is used for the Web Part.

# View OneDrive URLs for users in your organization

As a SharePoint Administrator, you can confirm OneDrive URLs for specific users in your organization. Whether youâ€™re troubleshooting, provisioning new accounts, or simply ensuring accurate information, understanding the methods to retrieve OneDrive URLs is essential.

## About OneDrive URLs

The URL for a user's OneDrive is usually in the following format: `https://<tenant name>-my.sharepoint.com/personal/<user principal name>`. For the user principal name (UPN), any special characters such as a period, comma, space, and the at sign ("@") are converted to underscores ("_"). See the following table for examples.

|Domain  |UPN  |OneDrive URL  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|`onmicrosoft.com`     |      `rsimone@contoso.onmicrosoft.com`   |    `https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/rsimone_contoso_onmicrosoft_com`     |
|custom     |    `rsimone@contoso.com`     |   `https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/rsimone_contoso_com`      |

Numbers or GUIDs might be appended to the URL if a conflict is detected. We recommend you confirm a user's OneDrive URL if you need to specify it.

> [!NOTE]
> Unless OneDrive accounts are [pre-provisioned](pre-provision-accounts.md), the URL isn't created until a user accesses their OneDrive for the first time.
>
> Also, the OneDrive URL will automatically change if the user's [UPN changes](upn-changes.md). For example, if the user changes their name or the domain name changes for a rebranding or business restructuring.
  
## Use the OneDrive usage report to view the list of OneDrive users and URLs

1. Go to the [OneDrive usage report in the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/reportsUsage/OneDriveSiteUsage) and sign in as a SharePoint Administrator, or reports reader. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have one of these roles in your organization. For additional roles with access see [Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide#who-can-see-reports))

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850627), browse to **Reports** \> **Usage**. Under  **OneDrive files**, select **View more**.

2. Scroll to the table below the charts.

    ![Table of URLs at the bottom of the OneDrive usage report](media/usage-report-table.png)

 If you see GUIDs in the table instead of URLs and names, go to the [Reports setting](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/Settings/Services/:/Settings/L1/Reports) and clear the box **In all reports, display deidentified names for users, groups, and sites**.

You can copy individual OneDrive URLs from the URL column. For easier searching and copying, export the table as a .csv file. In the upper left of the table, select **Export**.

## Use PowerShell to create a list of all the OneDrive URLs in your organization

The list you create in these steps are saved to a text file.
  
1. [Download the latest SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255251).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you installed a previous version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell, go to Add or remove programs and uninstall "SharePoint Online Management Shell."

2. Save the following text to a PowerShell file. For example, you could save it to a file named OneDriveSites.ps1.

    ```PowerShell
    $TenantUrl = Read-Host "Enter the SharePoint admin center URL"
    $LogFile = [Environment]::GetFolderPath("Desktop") + "\OneDriveSites.log"
    Connect-SPOService -Url $TenantUrl
    Get-SPOSite -IncludePersonalSite $true -Limit all -Filter "Url -like '-my.sharepoint.com/personal/'" | Select -ExpandProperty Url | Out-File $LogFile -Force
    Write-Host "Done! File saved as $($LogFile)."
    ```

3. Open the SharePoint Online Management Shell. Navigate to the directory where the script was saved and run:

    ```PowerShell
    PS C:\>.\OneDriveSites.ps1
    ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If an error message about being unable to run scripts appears, you'll need to change your execution policies. For more information, see [About Execution Policies](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies).

4. The script prompts you for the SharePoint admin center URL. For example, `https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com` is the Contoso SharePoint admin center URL.

5. When prompted, sign in with your SharePoint Administrator account credentials.

After the script successfully completes, a text file is created in the location specified by the **$LogFile** variable in the script. This file contains a list of all OneDrive URLs in your organization. The following text provides an example of how the list of URLs in this file should be formatted.
  
```https
https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/annb_contoso_onmicrosoft_com/
https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/carolt_contoso_onmicrosoft_com/
https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/esterv_contoso_onmicrosoft_com/  
https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hollyh_contoso_onmicrosoft_com/
```

Once you have the URL for a user's OneDrive, you can get more info about it by using the [Get-SPOSite](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/get-sposite) cmdlet, and change settings by using the [Set-SPOSite](/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-sposite) cmdlet.

### Other methods to retrieve OneDrive URLs

#### Method 1: Using the **Diagnostic Information** section in OneDrive settings

1. As an administrator of the OneDrive site, navigate to the site.
2. In the upper right-hand corner, select the **Settings** icon.
3. Select **OneDrive Settings** and **More Settings**.
4. Under the **Diagnostic Information** section, copy the OneDrive Web URL.

#### Method 2: Using PnP PowerShell (Get-PnPUserProfileProperty)

PnP PowerShell is a versatile tool for managing SharePoint and OneDrive. To retrieve the PersonalURL (OneDrive URL) for a user, follow these steps:

1. **Install PnP PowerShell** if you haven't already. Run the following command in PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    Install-Module PnP.PowerShell -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

    - If you need more details on installation, refer to the official PnP PowerShell installation guide.

2. Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Get-PnPUserProfileProperty -Account "user@example.com" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty PersonalUrl
    ```

    - Replace `"user@example.com"` with the actual user's email address.

#### Method 3: Microsoft Graph API

The Microsoft Graph API provides programmatic access to OneDrive and other Microsoft 365 services. To get the OneDrive URL using Graph API:

1. **Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module** if you haven't already. Use this command:

    ```powershell
    Install-Module Microsoft.Graph
    ```

    - For step-by-step instructions, check out this tutorial on installing PnP PowerShell for SharePoint Online and Azure Cloud Shell.

2. Authenticate and connect to Microsoft Graph:

    ```powershell
    Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Directory.ReadWrite.All", "Sites.ReadWrite.All", "Files.ReadWrite.All"
    ```

3. Retrieve the OneDrive URL for a specific user:

    ```powershell
    $userPrincipalName = "user@example.com"
    $userObject = Get-MgUser -Filter "userPrincipalName eq '$userPrincipalName'"
    $userOneDrive = Get-MgUserDefaultDrive -UserId $userObject.id
    $oneDriveWebUrl = $userOneDrive.webUrl
    Write-Host "OneDrive WebURL for $userPrincipalName: $oneDriveWebUrl"
    ```

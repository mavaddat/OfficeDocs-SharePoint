# Brand Colors

By strategically incorporating brand colors throughout your content, you can create a cohesive visual identity that resonates with your audience. These colors are more than mere aesthetic choices; they are powerful tools that evoke emotions, convey messages, and build recognition. Whether it's through a striking website, engaging social media graphics, or compelling marketing materials, the thoughtful use of color can transform ordinary content into an extraordinary experience that authentically expresses your organization's values and essence.

Brand colors are your organization’s colors that are uploaded and managed within the SharePoint brand center.  In this article, we talk about how to manage your brand colors so you can use them in Microsoft 365.

## Adding brand colors to the brand center

Once the brand center is enabled, brand managers can create, update, and manage their organization’s brand colors easily through the app.  

In the brand color library, you can add a new color to create a full list of available standard colors to be used in various experiences.

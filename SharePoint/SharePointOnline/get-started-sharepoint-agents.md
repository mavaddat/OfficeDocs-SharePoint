# Get started with SharePoint agents

[SharePoint agents](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-agents-in-sharepoint-69e2faf9-2c1e-4baa-8305-23e625021bcf), powered by AI, help users quickly find information and insights on SharePoint sites, pages, and document libraries. These agents access your organization's data the same way [Copilot in other Microsoft 365 apps](/sharepoint/sharepoint-copilot-best-practices#copilot-and-sharepoint) does, responding to users based on their access permissions to the data. This article discusses how admins can get started with SharePoint agents, including setting up pay-as-you-go billing and managing Azure resources for agents.

## Understand who can set up and use agents

| **Action**          | **Requirements for the user**                                                                                       |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Create and configure an agent** | - Assigned with a Copilot license or your organization has the pay-as-you-go billing set up<br>- Ability to add new files to a SharePoint site    |
| **Interact with an agent**    | - Assigned with a Copilot license or your organization has the pay-as-you-go billing set up                                                       |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your organization hasn’t adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot, it’s recommended to review the requirements and learn how to adopt it for your organization. [Learn more](/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-overview).  

## Use agents with Copilot licenses

Users can use SharePoint agents after being [assigned a Copilot license](/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-enable-users#assign-licenses). You can use the [Microsoft 365 Copilot setup guide](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?Q=learndocs#/modernonboarding/microsoft365copilotsetupguide) in the Microsoft 365 admin center to assign the required licenses to users. For more information, see [Assign licenses to users in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users) and [Microsoft 365 Copilot requirements](/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-requirements). See more about [controlling user access through licensing](/sharepoint/manage-access-agents-in-sharepoint#control-user-access-through-licensing).

## Use agents with pay-as-you-go billing

To use pay-as-you-go billing, you need to first set up SharePoint agents  as a resource in Azure. That resource is used whenever a user without a Microsoft 365 Copilot license uses a SharePoint agent. For more information, see [Use agents with pay-as-you-go billing](/sharepoint/sharepoint-agents-azure-billing).

## Comparison of Copilot licenses, pay-as-you-go billing, and the trial promotion

What does the user get with pay-as-you-go billing, a Copilot license and the trial promotion? Here is a comparison:

| [Licensed for Microsoft 365 Copilot](/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-licensing) | [Pay-as-you-go](/sharepoint/sharepoint-agents-azure-billing) Enabled | [Trial promotion access](/sharepoint/manage-trial-agents-sharepoint-powershell#what-is-the-trial-access-to-sharepoint-agents) opted In | What does the user get? |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| No                                      | No                    | No                          | Cannot create or use agents |
| No                                      | Yes                   | No                          | All unlicensed users get to create and use agents and are billed per pay-as-you-go billing. |
| No                                      | Yes                   | Yes                         | All unlicensed users can create and use agents up to 10,000 queries per month and then pay-as-you-go kicks in once the user exceeds the 10,000 queries limit for the month; or once the six-month promotion is over. |
| Yes                                     | Yes                   | Yes                         | - Licensed users can create and use agents without using the trial promotion or pay-as-you-go billing. <br>- Unlicensed users can create and use agents up to 10,000 queries per month and then pay-as-you-go kicks in once the user exceeds the 10,000 queries limit for the month; or once the six-month promotion is over. |
| Yes                                     | No                    | No                          | - Licensed users can create and use agents. <br>- Unlicensed users can't create or use agents. |

# Insights report on SharePoint agents

Insights report on SharePoint Agents provides SharePoint Administrators with rich information on the recently created SharePoint agents across all SharePoint sites and OneDrive sites within their organization. This report provides admins with the ability to learn about the sites with the highest number of agents created. Using this report, SharePoint admins can further govern and maintain the integrity of the content used by agents as grounding data.  

Insights report is a [SharePoint Advanced Management](/sharepoint/advanced-management) feature and available in organization with SharePoint Advanced Management add-on SKU or Microsoft 365 Copilot license. The insights report is based on the Microsoft audit data logged for SharePoint agents through the FileCreated and FileRenamed events.

You can generate and manage SharePoint agent Insights report in SharePoint Admin Center or with SharePoint Online Management Shell.

### Data collection for insights report  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't have a Microsoft SharePoint Premium - SharePoint Advanced Management license, you'll be asked to enable data collection, so that the product starts to collect the relevant audit data to build this report. Once enabled, the reports can be generated 24 hours later and contain data from the point of collection. Data is stored for 28 days. If no reports are generated even once in three months, data collection is paused and should be enabled again.

#### Enabling data collection

This PowerShell command starts collecting audit data for reports on activities from the last 28 days. 

```powershell
Start-SPOAuditDataCollectionForActivityInsights  
```

#### Disabling data collection

This PowerShell command stops collecting audit data for reports on activities from the last 28 days. 

```powershell

Stop-SPOAuditDataCollectionForActivityInsights  
```

#### Checking the data collection status 

Once data collection is enabled, the reports can be generated after 24 hours. To check whether reports can be generated, use the PowerShell command Get-SPOAuditDataCollectionStatusForActivityInsights. The command returns the current data collection status which can be "NotInitiated","InProgress", "Paused". Reports can be generated when the status is "InProgress". 

```powershell
Get-SPOAuditDataCollectionStatusForActivityInsights 
```

## Known experiences with SharePoint Agent Insights reports

The following are some known experiences with SharePoint Agent Insights reports generated in SharePoint Admin Center or using SharePoint Online Management Shell:

- A report can be rerun only after 24 hours since the last report generated.  

- In large tenants, it might take up to 48 hours for the data to be available.  

- Only one report can exist for each report range value (1, 7, 14, or 28 days). This means you can see a maximum of four reports at a given point.  

- The newly generated report replaces the previously created report with the same date range. To preserve the previously created report, download the report first before creating a new report for the same date range.  

- These reports are generated using Microsoft 365 unified audit data and might not cover all audit events.

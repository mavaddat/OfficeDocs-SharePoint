# Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go terms of service

Users can use consumption-based services for specific Microsoft 365 features by opting for pay-as-you-go billing through an Azure subscription. Here are the [pricing details](/sharepoint/microsoft-365-pay-as-you-go-pricing.md) for the service(s).

When you link your Azure subscription to a service for pay-as-you-go billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you're billed on a pay-as-you-go basis for the service you set up. You can [cancel or delete your subscription](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription) at any time to stop processing and billing.

In the future, new features using pay-as-you-go billing will be announced via a message center post. When the features become available, users in your organization will be able to take advantage of those capabilities. Pay as you go billing is disabled by default. A global admin or owner to the subscription can enable or disable Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go features in the Microsoft 365 admin center. 

## Prerequisites for Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go services

- Have an administrator role for the Microsoft 365 app. For instance, a SharePoint administrator role is necessary to configure pay-as-you-go billing for a SharePoint agents pay-as-you-go service.
- Have an owner or contributor Azure role to an Azure subscription to set up the pay-as-you-go service(s).
- Have an owner or contributor Azure role to an Azure resource group linked to the same Azure subscription to set up the pay-as-you-go service(s).

The organization’s consumption of the pay-as-you-go service can be monitored at the [Cost Management center](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_CostManagement/Menu/%7E/overview/openedBy/AzurePortal) for each of the Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go services that you use. Billing for services is done through the Azure subscription that you associate to the service.  

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft 365 pay-as-you-go is not available for Office 365 government plans or Office 365 operated by 21Vianet to and for PRC-located users.

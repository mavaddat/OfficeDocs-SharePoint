# Change settings for the Search Navigation Web Part

The Search Navigation Web Parts shows links that let users move quickly between the different search pages, known as search verticals. Search verticals are predesigned to give users different search experiences depending on what they are looking for. For example, if users click the **People** link, they are taken to the people search vertical, which is a search page specifically set up to display people information.
  
By default, the Search Navigation Web Part is set up to show links to the search verticals **Everything**, **People**, **Conversations** and **Videos**. The Search Navigation Web Part uses search results from the Search Results Web Part so that when users click a search vertical link, the search results are filtered and displayed according to how the search vertical is set up.
  
As a [SharePoint Administrator](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) or [above](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles) in Microsoft 365, you can change how the Search Navigation Web Part is set up by specifying a different Web Part to get the results from, change how many links to show, and change the appearance and layout of the Web Part. You make these changes by editing the properties in the Web Part tool pane.
  
To make other changes, such as changing display names for the links, or change their order, go to the **Search Settings** for the corresponding site. Here, you can also add a link to a new search vertical to be shown in the Web Part.

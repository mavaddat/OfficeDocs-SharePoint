## Overview

If you need to retain or delete content in Microsoft 365, we recommend using Microsoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management and Microsoft Purview Records Management features instead of older information management and records management features in SharePoint for Microsoft 365

We have a long-term deprecation plan for these older features. More information, including dates, is in the [deprecation timeline.](#deprecation-timeline) Feature deprecations are communicated in advance to give customers time to prepare and perform any applicable migration activities. 

The following older information management and records management features in SharePoint for Microsoft 365 are under consideration for deprecation: 

- Record Center 
    - [Create a record center site ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-records-center-6bf1488b-62a8-486c-90dd-54b6bcce4b3a#:~:text=You%20need%20to%20take%20the%20following%20steps%20to,on%20the%20Records%20Center%20site.%20...%20See%20More.)

## Deprecation summary

The following key points summarize how deprecation works:  

- Microsoft won't automatically migrate your older information management and records management features in SharePoint for Microsoft 365. If you choose not to migrate to supported features, the older features might no longer be supported.   
- Between now and the deprecation date of the feature, you have the flexibility to migrate your scenarios on your own schedule.  
- If you have configured SharePoint sites for content type policies or information management policies, those policies continue to be ignored while a retention policy or retention label policy is in effect. 
- Deprecation for features might include some or all the following outcomes:  
    - Microsoft might not support the feature.
    - It might no longer be visible in the user interface.  
    - Configurations might not be available through the user interface or programmatically, including enable and disable actions.  
    - When fully deprecated, backend services supporting behaviors for the feature might no longer function as expected.

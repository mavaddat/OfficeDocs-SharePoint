# Translate documents in OneDrive

> [!NOTE]
> Through June 2025, you can try out document translation and other selected Microsoft Syntex services at no cost if you have [pay-as-you-go billing](/microsoft-365/syntex/syntex-azure-billing) set up.
>
> For details on how to get started and the limitations, see [Try out Microsoft Syntex and explore its services](/microsoft-365/syntex/promo-syntex).

OneDrive, powered by Microsoft Syntex, allows you to manually translate documents while preserving the original format and structure. With this feature, you can create a translated copy of a single file or a set of files. The translation feature is available for all supported languages and dialects, and supports up to 10 languages per translation request.

## Key features

- **Multiple points of access**: OneDrive document translation can be accessed via **My files** in OneDrive or using the viewer after opening the document. If you want to access the document translation feature for SharePoint Online libraries, you can also access that feature through OneDrive's **Quick access** section. For more information about document translation for SharePoint Online, see [Overview of document translation in Microsoft Syntex](/microsoft-365/syntex/translation-overview).
- **Request multiple languages per translation**: You can select up to 10 languages per document translation.
- **Translation of different file types**: Translate various file types. [Supported file types](#supported-file-types) include .docx, .pdf, .pptx, and more.
- **Video transcripts and captions**: The translation feature also supports translating video transcripts and closed caption files. For more information, see [Transcript Translations in Stream for SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/microsoft-syntex-pay-as-you-go-transcript-translations-in-stream-for-sharepoint-2e34ad1b-e213-47ed-a806-5cc0d88751de).

## Prerequisites

To enable document translation for your tenant, you must:

- Link an Azure subscription to [Microsoft Syntex pay-as-you-go billing](/microsoft-365/syntex/syntex-azure-billing#connect-syntex-to-an-azure-subscription-for-billing).
- Be a [SharePoint Administrator](sharepoint-admin-role.md) or have credentials to access the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Enable document translation for your tenant

> [!NOTE]
> Once an Azure subscription is linked to Microsoft Syntex, the translation feature is automatically set up and turned on for all [SharePoint](/microsoft-365/syntex/translation-setup#set-up-translation) and OneDrive sites.

## Manage document translation for OneDrive

Even though OneDrive document translation is enabled by default, you can also turn off the feature.

To disable document translation for OneDrive:

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and select **[Setup](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2171997)**.
2. Expand **Files and content** and select **Automate content processes with Syntex**.
3. On the **Automate content processes with Syntex** page, select **Go to Syntex settings**.
4. On the Syntex page, in the **Document & image services** section, select **Document translation**.
5. In the OneDrive section, select **Edit**. On the **Where can document translation be used?** panel, clear the **Available in OneDrive** checkbox.

For more information about managing document translation for SharePoint sites, see [Set up and manage document translation in Microsoft Syntex](/microsoft-365/syntex/translation-setup#manage-sites).

## Translate a document

1. Select **My files**.

2. Select the file you want to translate and select the **More commands (...)** button in the ribbon.

    Alternatively, you can get to this feature by selecting **More Actions (...)** beside the file name or opening the document in the viewer.
